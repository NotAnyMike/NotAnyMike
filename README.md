### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I focus on understanding how to make current Machine Learning models understand their surroundings more efficiently. I am currently working on perception through monocular cameras, deeplearning and computer vision. Apart from that, I am also interested in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Autonomous Vehicles and lately in XR.
